# Zero-Knowledge Self-Verification Architecture (ZK-SVA)

A proof-of-concept Python architecture that enables **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to self-verify their outputs using cryptographic hashing and mock zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).  
Designed for **privacy-preserving, decentralized, and transparent AI responses**.

## What It Does

1. Accepts a natural language prompt  
2. Uses a pre-trained LLM (GPT-2) to generate an answer  
3. Generates a `digest` of the prompt + output using `BLAKE3`  
4. Simulates a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) for the output  
5. Verifies the proof before accepting the output as valid

## Why It Matters

> In a world where AI is used for decision-making, **trust and verifiability** are essential.  
ZK-SVA shows how an AI system can be built to **prove that it didn't hallucinate** — without revealing internal model weights or user data.
